# 1. Higher Order Component(HOC):

**A higher-order component (HoC) is a function that takes
original component and returns a new enhanced component.
const EnhancedComponent = higherOrderComponent(WrappedComponent).**

**A higher-order component (HOC) is an advanced technique in React for reusing component logic. HOCs are not part of the React API, per se. They are a pattern that emerges from React's compositional nature. Concretely, a higher-order component is a function that takes a component and returns a new component.**
